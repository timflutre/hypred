# hypred

This directory contains the hypred package for the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language and software environment for statistical computing.

This package, originally developed by Frank Technow, is not on the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) repository anymore, since, April 14, 2015, due to "memory-access errors".

I hence downloaded the code from the [CRAN archive](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/hypred), in order to (attempt to) fix this issue.
The original code corresponds to the first commit.
